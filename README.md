# Live-Bitcoin-Streaming
## This project is intended towards streaming Bitcoin live and then plotting the dynamic candlestick chart
- A websocket is created and linked to the site from where we are going to extract the live data.
- We will store the data into csv file.
- Then, we will be plotting dynamic candlesticks over a chart every 2 minutes.
